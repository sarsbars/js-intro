    Javascript is a hihgh level programming language that is used both on the 
    client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

    Javascript was invented in 1995 by Branden Eich. It was inspired by other 
    languages, "Scheme", "Self" and "Java".

    After Microsoft released Javascript, netscape submitted javascript to 
    ECMA International to standardize the language. This led to the official 
    release of ECMAScript of 1997.
